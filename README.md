## About
This repository includes small scripts focused on learning and correctly applying machine learning concepts using Pytorch. The projects range from basic linear and logistic regression to more advanced topics like transfer learning and custom datasets, implementations of fully connected linear neural networks and convolutional neural networks.

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:
- **Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR-10**: Implementation of a CNN to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- **Custom Datasets and Dataloaders**: Examples of creating custom datasets and dataloaders in Pytorch.
- **Example Tensorboard**: Demonstrating how to use Tensorboard with Pytorch.
- **FeedForward on MNIST**: Implementation of a feedforward neural network for MNIST digit classification.
- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear regression model.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implementation of logistic regression.
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying transfer learning to a new dataset.
- **House Price Prediction**: Predicting house prices using a regression model.
